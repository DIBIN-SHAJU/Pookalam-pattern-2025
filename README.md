Onam, the harvest festival of Kerala, is celebrated with vibrant traditions, cultural performances, and the creation of beautiful **Pookalams** — intricate floral carpets that symbolize joy, unity, and prosperity.  
This project brings that cultural art form into the **digital world** using **Python Turtle graphics**.

The code generates a stunning **multi-layered Pookalam pattern** featuring:  
- A **sunflower-inspired inner design**  
- A **spiral square pattern** that adds depth and symmetry  
- An **outer sunflower layer** that completes the floral artwork  
- A festive greeting: *“Happy Onam 2025”*

By combining **mathematics, geometry, and programming**, this project demonstrates how tradition and technology can merge to create something truly artistic.  
It’s not only a coding exercise but also a celebration of culture, creativity, and the beauty of **Onam**.
